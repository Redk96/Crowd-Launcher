# Crowd-Launcher

The barriers to raising capital for any person in the world, regardless of their situation in life is being eroded, any person is now able to create an Eth address and issue tokens in return for a chosen form of tokenised contributions. soon this process will be automated; opening capital markets to people without specialised blockchain knowledge. These new financial markets will continue to grow.. and barriers continue to be removed, 

Launching tokens over uniswap has many issues; front running, order rematching , MEV and of course price slippage.the next evolution for decentralised launches has seen the rise in IDO platforms. ensuring the fair distribution of tokens at a fixed price for retail and giving incubator and social validation to both investors and projects.

However, upon researching many of these IDO platforms share common inefficiencies:
- fair market price for the retail alloction is arbitrarily assigned
- lottery draws private and walled off from public verification
- token distribution is limited to closed off VC channels 
- the IDOs themselves are walled off communities and not aggregated
- automation of raises is not available  

the addition of purely onchain raises will considerably reduce both barriers and overheads to running an IDO:
auction lotteries 
english auctions
dutch auctions
fixed rate swaps....
gives projects the feedom to select how they want to public raise. 
(Private allocations will remain private or OTC) 

As a consequence of removing barriers to launching a DAO there will be scams occuring. This is mainly due to the lack of gatekeepers and proffesional vetting. 
To address this issue, I propose the use of social/community valuation and attestation collatoralised through staking by the appraiser, acompanied by account verification. Verified community appraisers and recognised VC can earn followers and reputation scores. the history of their attestation stakes and investment history verified onchain. allowing people to "copy invest". 

allowing leaders to register onchain accounts and issue their own NFTs to people that want to be members of their community
