# Crowd-Launcher
Trustless marketplace for investors and pitchers to connect and transact globally, utilising blockchain infrastructure  


Any person anywhere in the world should be able to create an Eth address and issue tokens in return for a chosen form of tokenised contributions. without in-depth knowledge of codeing or blockchains. the enviroment between all parties should be trustless.  

Launhing tokens over uniswap has many issues; front running, order rematching , MEV and of course price slippage.the next evolution for decentralised launches has seen the rise in IDO platforms. ensuring the fair distribution of tokens at a fixed price for retail and giving incubator and social validation to both investors and projects.

However, upon researching many of these IDO platforms share common inefficiencies:
- fair market price for the retail alloction is arbitrarily assigned
- lottery draws private and walled off from public verification
- token distribution is limited to closed off VC channels 
- the IDOs themselves are walled off communities and not aggregated
- automation of raises is not available  

the addition of purely onchain raises will considerably redue both barriers and overheads to running an IDO:
auction lotteries 
english auctions
dutch auctions
fixed rate swaps....
gives projects the feedom to select how they want to public raise. 


By opening up the barriers to launching a DAO there will be scams occuring. this is why I propose the use of social/ community valuation and staking. Also have verified investors and their investment history verified onhain. allowing people to "copy invest"

allowing leaders to register onchain accounts and issue their own NFTs to people that want to be members of their community
